This is the initial website describing the HighResMIP protocol. Further information is currently being added but in the meantime please [contact us](/about/contact/) for more information.

The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) was a CMIP6 endorsed MIP and applied, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution.
A coordinated set of experiments were designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments was divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility to extend to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments.

The HighResMIP protocol is described in detail in Haarsma et al. 2016 (Haarsma, R. J., et al.: High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP v1.0) for CMIP6, Geosci. Model Dev., 9, 4185â€“4208, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-4185-2016">10.5194/gmd-9-4185-2016</a>, 2016.). There is a special issue of GMD entitled "CMIP6 HighResMIP model descriptions and basic properties" for description papers specific to HighResMIP. 

The whole of the HighResMIP data archive can be accessed via ESGF, via the different ESGF nodes, e.g. the <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/">LLNL node</a>, <a href="https://esgf-index1.ceda.ac.uk/search/cmip6-ceda/">UK CEDA  node</a>, and search under CMIP6/HighResMIP.

HighResMIP2 is designing the successor to HighResMIP. We are considering what new science questions to tackle, what changes to the experimental design to consider, what data and diagnostics to produce and what metrics and tools to use. Our aim is to have an updated experimental protocol sometime in mid-2023.
