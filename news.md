News on HighResMIP

### 29/08/2023
As part of UK preparations for CMIP7, a workshop is being held at Reading University on 04/09/2023. The HighResMIP co-leads have put together a <a href="/assets/images/documents/UKCMIP7_Sept2023_HighResMIP_MalcolmRoberts_poster.pdf"> poster </a> to indicate some of their thinking for HighResMIPv2, and a draft of a new protocol paper is being worked on.

### 30/08/2023
We are holding a workshop between HighResMIP and the EU <a href="https://eerie-project.eu"> EERIE </a> project on Wed 8th Nov at around 2pm European time. Three groups in EERIE will (hopefully) by then be running new coupled HighResMIP simulations with eddy-rich oceans. The workshop will discuss HighResMIP plans (including discussion of the draft protocol paper), analysis ideas and how HighResMIP and EERIE can best work together. This is part of the EERIE General Assembly in Bremerhaven, Germany, which includes a hackathon over the following two days. Further details will follow, but if you'd be interested in joining in person please let us know.
